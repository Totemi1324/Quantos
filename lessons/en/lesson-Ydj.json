        "text": "In almost all physical effects, electrons play a significant role. Since electrons carry charge, they also generate an electric field. If you set the electron in motion, you get a magnetic field in addition. If an electron penetrates another external electric field, its path is changed due to the Lorentz force. The electrons bound in an atom, form its electron shell. In chemistry, these are the most important. "
