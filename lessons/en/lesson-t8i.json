Since the QUBO equation is based on N, the size of the chessboard, it takes up NÂ² logical qubits (meaning that the necessary number of physical qubits increases at an extremely fast rate as the problem size increases) and must be recalculated for each board size. The 4 queens problem needs 16 logical qubits, the 5 queens problem 25, the 6 queens problem 36, and so on."

Thus, they can also be viewed as a characteristic **fingerprint** of corresponding optimization problems. Here is the Hamilton matrix of the 4 queens problem just solved:"

This is done in the background using the Ocean SDK, which provides a communication interface between the end user and DWave's servers. Upon submission, the embedding is automatically generated and at least a few hundred measurements are taken to balance the randomness of the quantum physical state transitions as much as possible. The computation time consumed in this process is deducted from the own DWave Leap account. Instructions are available on our website. However, all this is optional; in the next lesson the results are presented."
